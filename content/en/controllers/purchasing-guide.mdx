## Intro

This guide is for helping players decide what controller to purchase. Be warned that controllers are expensive! Before committing to a purchase, try the game either at an arcade or with your keyboard. Make sure you like the game first!

Not all possible controllers will be covered. There are many different controllers out there, but these are the most popular ones.

## Arcade-size Controllers (ASCs) [#arcade-size-controllers]

The two main options when it comes to ASCs are FAUCETWO+ and YuanCon. Both have arcade-accurate layouts, offer identical gameplay experiences, and their parts are easily customizable.

### FAUCETWO+

<Image src="/controllers/faucetwos.png" alt="faucetwo+" caption="FAUCETWO+ VW skin (left) and EG skin (right)" />

Manufactured by GAMO2, this is the most popular and frequently recommended controller to purchase. Many reviews can be found on YouTube, with [Tokaku's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGUSWQXGf6Y) being the most popular.

They offer two versions of their controller: the Vivid Wave (VW) or Exceed Gear (EG) skin. Besides the aesthetic difference, the EG skin version includes the price of a metal plate which must be configured separately for the VW skin version.

[Product Detail Page](https://www.gamo2.com/en/product/faucetwo+/)

#### Dimensions [#faucetwo-dimensions]

The FAUCETWO+ measures 46.4 x 23.4 x 10.9 cm (L x W x H) and weighs 4.2 kg (9.3 lbs). Height includes knobs. More details can be found on the [specs page](https://www.gamo2.com/en/product/faucetwo+/specs.html).

#### Pros & Cons [#faucetwo-pros-cons]
**\+** More pre-purchase customization options\
**\+** Arcade-accurate knobs tops\
**\+** Toolless access to internals\
**\-** More expensive compared to YuanCon\
**\-** Slightly larger and heavier than a YuanCon SDVX LITE 3

<Callout>
  For US residents, GAMO2 occasionally restocks their [US storehouse](https://www.gamo2.com/en/index.php?dispatch=categories.view&category_id=281) a few times a year and most commonly around Black Friday. Their controllers can be purchased for much cheaper as the cost of shipping is greatly reduced. They announce restocks on their [Twitter page](https://x.com/GamoTwo).
</Callout>

#### Configuration Options [#faucetwo-configuration]

- **Button and spring:**

  - **DJDAO (recommended):** Cheaper default option which can be considered a Chinese clone of Sanwa buttons
  - **Sanwa:** More premium option which are used in arcade cabinets

If you select DJDAO, choose the option with 60g springs.
If you select Sanwa, choose the option with 20g springs.

- **Microswitch of BT/FX buttons:**

  - **Honeywell:** Cheapest option with poor durability
  - **Omron (recommended):** Most common option with good durability
  - **OBSA-LHS1F:** These switches are used in arcade cabinets. Note that you **must** select Sanwa buttons as they are not compatible with DJDAO buttons.

See the [parts page](/controllers/parts) for more detailed information about buttons, springs, and switches.

- **Knob unit type:**

  - **VM Style knob unit:** GAMO2's reproduction of the knob assembly used in Valkyrie Model arcade cabinets
  - **GAMO2 damping knob unit (recommended):** Cheaper default option but still perform well

- **Metal panel:** A metal panel that aims to improve the feel and sound of
  the controller. [Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230318033718/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dGnRTtvpA4) is an archived showcase
  of it by Neardayo.


##### Arcade-accurate Configuration [#faucetwo-arcade-accurate-configuration]

<Image src="/controllers/arcadecontroller.png" alt="faucetwo+ arcade specs" className="w-128" />


#### FAUCETWO and FAUCETWO+ Differences [#faucetwo-plus-differences]

The FAUCETWO+ is an improved version of the FAUCETWO that was introduced in November 2023. The main differences compared to the older FAUCETWO are:

- Knob assembly no longer uses consumable rubber dampeners
- Knob tension is adjustable without tools
- Only one USB cable is necessary, with a second being optional for brighter lights
- Exceed Gear skin option
- Metal plate option

The original FAUCETWO has been discontinued, but it is worth knowing about these differences if you happen to purchase one secondhand.

### YuanCon

<Image src="/controllers/yuancons.png" alt="yuancons" caption="SDVX 12 (left) and SDVX LITE 3 (right)" />

Manufactured by YuanCon, another popular choice for controllers. As of April 2025, they offer two SDVX controllers:

- SDVX 12 is the more expensive option with a larger case and many lights
- SDVX LITE 3 is the cheaper option with a smaller case (layout is unchanged) and fewer lights

The differences besides the cost are purely aesthetic, so the SDVX LITE 3 is more often recommended.

[Purchase Link](https://yuancon.store/controller)

#### Dimensions [#yuancon-dimensions]

The SDVX 12 measures 49 x 22 x 9.6 cm (L x W x H) and weighs 4.7 kg (10.4 lbs). Height includes knobs.

The SDVX LITE 3 measures 42 x 20 x 9.8 cm (L x W x H) and weighs 3.7 kg (8.2 lbs). Height includes knobs.

#### Pros & Cons [#yuancon-pros-cons]

**\+** Cheaper compared to FAUCETWO+\
**\+** (SDVX LITE 3) More transportable due to smaller size\
**\-** Limited customization options before purchase\
**\-** Knobs tops are not arcade-accurate (completely smooth and not faceted)\
**\-** Knob tension adjustment is finicky (does not apply to controllers made after March 2025)\
**\-** Poor USB port design commonly leads to failure (a spare is provided)\
**\-** Internal access requires tools\
**\-** Paint coating of the case can chip

#### Configuration Options [#yuancon-configuration]

Both the SDVX 12 and SDVX LITE 3 have an option for Sanwa buttons with 20g springs and OBSA-LHS1F switches. This is the configuration used in arcade cabinets.

## Other Input Devices

These input devices can trivialize patterns that are normally difficult on arcade-size controllers. Especially in higher level charts (17+) where [one-hands](/terminology/patterns#one-hand) and [hand-trips](/terminology/patterns#hand-trip) are more prevalent.

### Keyboards

If you do not have access to an arcade, it is recommended to try the game with a keyboard first. There are many different keybinds that you can use but if you're unsure check out out [this guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/kshootmania/comments/ndn1j2/tips_on_key_bindings_for_playing_sdvxksmusc_with/) by JiminP.

### Mini Controllers

<Image src="/controllers/minicontrollers.png" alt="mini controllers" caption="Speedy Labs SDVX Pico v5 (left) and FAUCETWO Portable Edition (right)" />

These are controllers are well made but are not recommended due to the smaller layout and cost (nearly as expensive as a YuanCon SDVX LITE 3). They are valid options for those looking to play on the go or want a quieter option (ASCs are loud!) but not suitable as an ASC alternative.

## Not Recommended Controllers

### Konami's Official SDVX Controllers

#### SDVX -Nemsys- Entry Model

<Image src="/controllers/entrymodel.jpg" alt="konami entry model" className="w-80" />

Not recommended due to notoriously poor build quality, with all parts being made of plastic and the buttons using rubber membranes instead of microswitches like other ASCs and arcade cabinets. Those looking for a "cheap" controller should not be tempted--**avoid it at all costs**.


#### SDVX -Nemsys- Ultimate Model rev.2

<Image src="/controllers/ultimatemodel.jpg" alt="konami ultimate model" className="w-80" />

Not to be confused with the Entry Model as the build quality of this controller is comparable to a FAUCETWO+ or YuanCon. If you can purchase one for a similar price to those two, it is a decent option. Otherwise, it does not offer anything worth the extra cost.

### Other Uncommon Controllers

The following controllers are largely uncommon and lack sufficient information and reviews. Therefore, it is hard to say how they perform or if they are worth the money. Troubleshooting may also be difficult compared to the popular options. A single comprehensive review of them can be found in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kshootmania/comments/xx0d0l/the_classic_sdvx_home_controller_debate_gamo2_vs).

#### [ISTMALL NEW Sabolcon Arcade Type](https://www.us.istmall.co.kr/Product/Detail/view/pid/404/cid/113)

#### [Genbu SDVX PC USB Controller](https://www.genbu.store/products/genbusdvx?variant=d5e48ac1-6ccf-4f35-948b-82e5c1e2d2ab&spm=..product_8d87f21f-8a7d-4cd6-854a-f5de0729db4b.header_1.1&spm_prev=..product_8d87f21f-8a7d-4cd6-854a-f5de0729db4b.header_1.1)

#### [Genbu SDVX Controller](https://www.genbu.store/products/sdvx?cfb=97d4eac8-9a12-4230-83c6-53bf64d49496&scm=collection.v38.177.202.875.204&score=0.16125942900665874&ssp=-&spm=..collection_bc26a26c-6231-43fb-b335-05e3a3d9d670.collection_1.3&spm_prev=..index.header_1.1)

This controller is unique as it uses optical switches instead of the standard snap-action. However, this means the buttons have no tactile feedback. The FX buttons are also slightly closer together than arcade-spec. [Here is an in-depth review video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPDIgpJYQGk), but it is only available in Japanese.
