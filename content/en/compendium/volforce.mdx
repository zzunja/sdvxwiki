## Volforce
Volforce is the main way seen to measure "skill". Of course, it's not 100%, but in theory, higher Volforce = better you are. 

Your Volforce is a combination of your best 50 plays. After every play, the game calculates the Volforce of that play with this equation.

<Callout>
This equation is technically wrong. Voltex doesn't multiply it by .001, it just rounds down to a whole number. It then takes that number, adds it to the best 50, then divides that sum by 1000. I add the .001 to simplify this whole process. It still gives the same answer, just different ways to get to that.

\* For Konasute, UC is worth 1.05

For example, if I got a score of `9,923,042 (S)` on a `level 18.3` with an `Excessive Rate clear`, this is how I would calculate my Volforce.
<div className="text-center mt-3">
 ```
(Level*(Score / 10,000,000)*(Grade Coefficient)*(Clear Coefficient)*20)*.001
```
</div>
<div className="mt-3">
```
Level             = 18.3
Score             = 9,923,042
Grade Coefficient = S = 1.05
Clear Coefficient = Excessive Rate = 1.02
 
  (18.3*(9,923,042 / 10,000,000)*(1.05)*(1.02)*20)*.001 
                  = 0.388969354141

```
</div>
This gives me `0.388969354141`. Since Voltex rounds down from the 3rd digit, we can just cut everything after the 3rd digit and get our answer `.388`.
<br/>

After it calculates this number, it then compares it to your best 50. If this
number is higher than the lowest Volforce play in your best 50, you will gain
the difference of that Volforce. For example, let's look at our last example.
Let's say I just set that score. Voltex will look at the lowest VF score in my
best 50. If that was `.370`, it would replace that Volforce with this one and I
will gain 
<div className="flex justify-center mt-3">
```
.388 - .370 = 0.018 Volforce 
```
</div>

This will be shown on the screen next to your Volforce if this happens.

The important things to note is that the only things taken into consideration is **Level of the Chart, Score, Clear type, and Grade**.

Also, your volforce is calculated as **your best clear and your best score** on
a chart. For example lets say I play the same chart from the last example, but got a `9,899,320` with a `UC`.
Voltex would replace the Excesssive clear with a UC but keep my higher score of `9,923,042`.

With the equation it would look like this
<div className="mt-3">
```
Level             = 18.3
Score             = 9,923,042 # This keeps the best score
Grade Coefficient = S = 1.05
Clear Coefficient = UC = 1.06 # This has changed 
 
  (18.3*(9,923,042 / 10,000,000)*(1.05)*(1.06)*20)*.001 
                  = 0.404223054304

```
</div>
This would equal `.404` VF.

Note the `1.02` has changed to a `1.06`, but it used the better score that I
originally had. This means I would gain 
<div className="flex justify-center mt-3">
```
.404 - .388  = .016 Volforce
```
</div>
for increasing my Excessive to a UC on this chart, even if my UC was a worse score.


### Finding your best 50
You can tell what is in your best 50 if it has what is circled in red.

<Image src='/compendium/volforce/best50.png'/>

The symbol next to the best 50 will be different depending on what your current VF is.

There is also a Best 50 folder, although note that this is not sorted by Volforce but rather by whatever sort you have selected.

## Skill Ranks
There are different skill ranks for different milestones in Volforce. Here are all of them:

<Image src='/compendium/volforce/volforceranks.png' className="w-100"/>


Every rank has four separate "gates".

At Imperial `20.00 VF`, instead of ranking up every `1.000 VF`, it changes to
every `4.000 VF`. This is currently the cap on VF rank. There is nobody that is
past this point because there aren't enough charts to fill up your best 50 enough
to reach past `24.000 VF`.

The two people that are currently max VF are [Mini](https://www.youtube.com/@minisdvx7740) and [Jakads](https://www.youtube.com/@Jakads_realkk). They have PUC every 20 to come out. 

## Volforce Potential Folder
Upon playing Nabla for the first time, A new folder called "Volforce Potential" may appear.
<Image src="/compendium/volforce/volforcepotential.png"/>

The Volforce Potential folder contains scores that could be in your best 50 but currently is not in it. Since Nabla doesn't recalculate your Volforce upon starting, there may be charts that could be in your best 50 that you haven't recalculated.

For example, lets say you had a best 50 filled with 19 S Excessive Clears in your best 50 before exceed gear. In Exceed Gear, this was worth `.402` VF. That means, you need a score worth over `.402` VF to gain VF. 

Upon starting Nabla, since decimal system is now in place, an 18.6 UC is now worth `.409`. This would be bigger then `.402` VF and could be in your Best 50 if you played it again and let the game recalculate it. So if you had a UC on a 18.6 song, this would appear in your best 50.

## Notes
Volforce is calculated on the machine. Meaning, if you set a play that raises
your Volforce on a new song, and than play a cab that doesn't have that song,
your Volforce will be calculate as if you hadn't played that song.

Essentially, when carding in, all scores are sent over and seen on the cab. It than calculates your Volforce using what it has.

Volforce for your score is calculate upon getting the score. After every chart, the game will calculate the Volforce for that and put it with the score. This is why in Nabla, you have to recalculate your Volforce as Nabla doesn't recalculate each scores Volforce again, only what it knows.

### Nabla
In Nabla, your highest Volforce isn't calculated upon login. If you transfer your data from Exceed Gear to nabla, it will not recalculate your VF and your VF may be lower then what it could be. Since Nabla added Decimals, Some of your scores may be worth more VF then how it was in Exceed Gear. You will have to recalculate these scores by playing them one time. It doesn't matter what score you get, just need to play it once to recalculate.

For example, if you had a S on an 18 in your Best 50 in Exceed Gear, then in Nabla, that 18 became a 18.4, you can replay that 18 to get the Volforce for it being increased by .4.

Nabla also buffed UC multiplier by .01
