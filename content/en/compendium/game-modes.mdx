## Intro
There are a couple different gamemodes other than just normal play. In this section, we will go over each one and what they are and what the difference between them all are.

<Callout>If you are playing Konasute コナステ, the only two game modes available are normal and skill analyzer. Most of what is being said here does not apply to you.</Callout>
## Normal
Normal, or a normal play is the default play for Sound Voltex. Usually, this is
the cheapest option. There exist 2 types of normal play, light and standard
play. Light can be cheaper, but has some downsides. 
- Light start doesn't have S-Crits, or [ARS](/compendium/gauge-options/#alternative-rate-system-ars) along with some other options
- There is a max of 3 songs per credit, can't get ex-track.
- If you fail a song, your credit will end
- There are level restrictions depending on what dan you are. The lower the dan, the higher the level of restrictions. Only on the last song will you be able to play any chart regardless of the level

If you are in the US, most likely light and standard are the same amount of credits. There is no point in ever choosing light in that case.

After selecting a song, you will go into matching. Here you can wait for someone to join you or just skip by pressing both FX buttons.

## Friend
Friend is how you can play with another person at your arcade. Friend is only
local meaning that both you and your friend have to be at the same arcade on two
machines. This game mode works similarly to Normal play. 

Once in, you both will see a song selection and can select a song. You will be able to 
see everything you both have unlocked, so for example if Person A doesn't have 666 
but Person B does, Person A will be able to see and select 666. Once someone
selects something, it will show up on the other screen for them to choose what
difficulty they want to play at. After selecting, you both will go into matching
together. 

You can play a max of 3 credits together regardless of whether you both get an ex-track or not. If you get an ex-track, it will act as if you are just doing a normal credit.

## Battles
Battles is how you can play with other people from anywhere. There are 3
different types of battles, Arena battle, Single battle, and Megamix battle. For
all of these there is a choice of Online or Local. Local means only people in
your arcade while online means anyone from anywhere can match. When choosing
online, you will be forced to put in a 6-digit code, and everyone who wants to
join the room also has to put in this 6-digit code.

### Single battle
Match with one other person. Each person selects the chart they want to play. After selected, it is randomly decided whos chart goes first. Whoever scores higher wins and gets a star. The final chart is randomly selected, but usually is around the difficulty that was played. 

### Arena battle
Match with up to 4 people. Each person selects the chart they want to play.
After everyone selects, it then chooses a random chart from the ones selected.
You can choose what difficulty you want to play at and then start. 

If you are playing with 2 people, both players will select a main chart and a
sub chart. After both main charts are played, the loser sub chart will play. For
3 players, everyone selects one chart.

At the end of the chart, whoever was 1st will get 2 stars and whoever was second
will get 1 star. Whoever has the most stars by the end of the 4 charts wins. 

If you are playing online and you don't have enough people to fill the lobby, it
will be filled with CPUs. This doesn't happen in local. The CPUs will pick a
random chart that is typically around the level you were playing. 

Light start will add restrictions to what level and difficulty can be selected. If someone selects light start, they will not be able to change difficulty

### Megamix battle
Megamix battles are a completely different kind of battle. Megamix battles are
1v1 battles in which each person selects 5 charts that they want to play. Unlike
the other battles, the chart difficulty you select will be the one played by
both players. In total, 10 charts will be selected. Depending on who you are,
you will choose the intro or outro chart. 

Once in, the intro chart selected will play. After the round, player 2 will get
to choose a chart from the 5 charts that he selected on the touchscreen. You can
also select mirror from here as well. Besides the intro and outro chart, you can
only select a chart once.

There are 12 rounds, with each round consisting of about 30 seconds of a portion of the chart selected. Whoever scores better on that portion wins a point. If you tie, you both get a point.

There is a exceed gear meter that will build up and can be seen on the right side of the screen. The gauge is built up as you play. Before any chart starts, pressing "EXCEED" on the touchscreen will activate the "EXCEED" mode. "EXCEED" mode does a couple of things.
- Scoring is now based on ex-score instead of normal scoring. Meaning, that you can PUC a chart, but if your exscore is worse then you will still lose.
- Since scoring is based on ex-score, the ex-score is converted into a normal score. So, while it still shows up as a normal score, even if you PUC, you won't get a 10,000,000 unless you S-PUC.
- If you win while in your exceed mode, you will gain bonus points depending on what level your exceed was. The higher the level the exceed, the more points.
- If you lose, your exceed will be shut down and you will gain no points. Your opponent will only gain 1 point.
- There is a built in comeback mechanic with exceed where if you are behind, you will gain more gauge for your exceed. The farther behind you are, the faster it builds up.
- Exceed mode will always activate on the last round no matter if you pressed it or not. Both players will use what is left of their exceed gauge.

There are a lot of things that go into this mode that are much better explained
by just watching gameplay of it. If you are confused, I would highly recommend
watching some gameplay. Here are some really good players playing Megamix.

- [Neardayo vs DDX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYB8O1esX_4)
- [Potesatsu playing megamix update for the first time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHUrTmyRAiQ)
- [YU11 vs STR and whole megamix playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrQgOXj6BbM&list=PLx9MzlxDs2fywFGg2OV0hBfbsSRhiXkav)
- [Neardayo vs EmoCosine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrPheTslzck)

Some other small things to note about Megamix
- Not all charts are available for Megamix. Noteably recent charts are usually not in megamix. Konami does sometimes add all the new charts to Megamix.
- Gimmicks from boss charts like 666 lane split, Lachyrma lane disappear, and other gimmicks do not show up.
- There are no lane speed changes. So charts that normally have soflan are just played at whatever lane speed you are set to.

## Premium Time
Premium time is usually the more expensive option. This comes with some perks with the main one being that you can play all you want for 10 minutes.
#### Pros
- 10-minute timer instead of a set amount of tracks
- All the features of standard start
- Access to MAXXIVE rate
- Can exit a chart at any time by pressing both fx and start
- Can instantly retry a chart by holding both fx and start
- Can set a challenge where you will automatically crash out if you can no longer achieve the challenge (For example, if I set it to PUC challenge and then got a near, It would crash me out)
- Pressing all BT buttons on Song Select can end your credit early
#### Cons 
- No blaster gate
- Because of no blaster gate, can't unlock any songs that make use of the blaster gauge
- More expensive

Premium time is nice for when you are grinding for a score or clear on a chart and want to be able to play and repeat the chart multiple times.

## Blaster start
Blaster start is usually the same price as a premium time. Blaster Start is
mainly used to unlock stuff. Blaster start acts as a normal start, meaning 3-4
charts, no resetting, etc. The main difference is that your blaster gauge is
always full for all 3-4 charts. So, you can unlock multiple Blaster Gate/Omega
Dimension/Hexadiver charts in one credit.

Blaster Start also has access to [MAXXIVE rate](/compendium/gauge-options#maxxive-rate).


Note for Hexadivers, on the `Akasha` and `Don't you dare play GOD` Hexadivers, you
can only go in them one time per credit. So if you used your first track on
unlocking something in one of those Hexadivers, you will not be able to access
either of them for the rest of the credit. This only applies to those two
Hexadivers.

You can learn more about Hexadivers [here](/compendium/unlock-systems#hexadiver)

## Skill Analyzer
If you are familiar with other rhythm games, Skill Analyzer is essentially the dan of this game. It is a gauntlet of 3 songs that you have to beat in a row while keeping your [gauge](/compendium/gauge-options#permissive-rate). Once you hit 0% gauge you fail the course.

<div className="flex items-center justify-center">
 <img src='/compendium/game-modes/skillanalyzer.jpg' width="400"/>
</div>
When selecting the skill analyzer, you can choose what dan you would like to
challenge. This is shown at the top. In the dan, you can choose from different
courses you would like to try. You can see the 3 songs that will be in the
course and what your current best score and completion is. Note that if you
don't have the songs unlocked, you won't be able to play the course.

To gain access to the 神 dan, or the final dan, you first have to beat any course from the 11th dan skill analyzer.

Pressing all four BT buttons at the same time will activate [DIVINE RATE](/compendium/gauge-options#divine-rate),
which is a much harder version of the normal gauge. This gauge will only restore
on S-CRITICALSs, and NEARs will penalize the gauge. In addition, the achievement rate
required to obtain a halo is 10% higher. The achievement rate is based on the sum of the
EX score among all three played course songs, such that an average EX score of 9x.x% will
result in a completion rate of 1xx%.

There are different styles of frames you can obtain:
- Silver wings: Clear the latest course to come out.
- Gold wings: Clear all courses.
- Halo: Clear all courses with a specified achievement rate or higher as shown in the table below.
- Divine Halo: Clear all courses with a specific achievement rate or higher as shown in the table AND play with [DIVINE RATE](/compendium/gauge-options#divine-rate)
<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-5">
  | Skill Level | 1-9 | 10 | 11 | ∞ |
  |:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
  | Achievement Rate (Regular) | 130% | 150% | 160% | 170% |
  | Achievement Rate (神/Divine) | 140% | 160% | 170% | 180% |
</div>

Having a higher dan will increase your restriction level in normal light start.

Here are all the dans image. Note that the wings, halo, and divine halo can be put on any dan, but in this image it only shows 神 dan.

## Training Mode
<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
This is a **[Konasute](/setup/konasute) exclusive** setting, requiring the purchase of the [Premium Pass](/setup/konasute#premium-pass)
</Callout>

Training mode is a mode exclusive to Konasute. This allows for extensive practicing of charts or sections of charts. In training mode you can
- Select certain measures to practice
- Change speed 
- Remove Camera effects and lane speed changes
- and more

Training mode is not available on certain charts, mainly all license charts. This includes BMS, Touhou, and Vocaloid charts.

To start, you must first own [Konasute](/setup/konasute) and the [Premium Pass](/setup/konasute#premium-pass). Open Konasute and select `Training` from the gamemode options.

<Image src="/compendium/game-modes/trainingmodefirstscreen.webp" className="w-90"/>

Upon starting a chart, you will get a screen like this. Here is the translation.

The controls are
- `FX-L` or `ESC`: Open options
- `Knob` or Left and Right arrow keys: Scroll through the start. Holding `FX` will let you scroll faster
- `BT-A`: Set starting measure for loop
- `BT-D`: Set ending measure for loop
- `FX-L + FX-R + START` or `.` (Numpad): for starting the loop. Hold to start at the starting measure

At the top, it shows the current spread of hits and average ms difference between the spread. 

On the left you can see your current S-Crit, Crit, Near, and Error.

Below that is the current play speed, if repeat is on, and if autoplay is on. You can adjust the Play Speed by either using the options menu or using the Up and Down arrow keys.

Opening the options menu will give you a screen like this.

<Image src="/compendium/game-modes/trainingmodeoptions.webp" className="w-90"/>

- `PLAY SPEED`: Current speed of the chart. Can go to .5 - 1.5
- `REPEAT`: If it will automatically repeat upon reaching the ending measure
- `AUTOPLAY`: Automatically plays the chart
- `Fix Lane Speed`: Removes any lane speed changes caused by BPM changes
- `Fix Camera/Lane`: Removes any camera/lane effects.
- `Starting Gauge`: Sets where the gauge starts at

Pressing `FX-L` again will close this menu.


Upon pressing `FX-L + FX-R + START` or `.` the chart will start playing. Holding `FX-L + FX-R + START` or `.` will restart the chart. Pressing `FX-L + FX-R + START` or `.` just once will pause the chart.

The same keyboard shortcuts also work here. `ESC` to open menu, Up and Down arrow keys to adjust play speed, Left and Right keys to move through the chart.


When you have selected a section and play it, your score will be of that section. So, if you select 5 measures than PUC that measure, your score will be `10000000` or a PUC.

Scores made will not be submitted or shown anywhere, even if started from the beginning of the chart. You will never go to the score results screen.
