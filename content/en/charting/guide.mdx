## Syncing Audio
<Callout>This guide takes a lot of stuff from [Teds guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rDpndXsPxBsGQi_DkUmqAxq0PrmXjrPCWnK_zk639kQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.z7y5vobdqtty). If you find you are confused, it might be easier to read that guide as he syncs his songs slightly differently </Callout>

Before starting to chart, we have to sync the audio for the chart. This guide will be using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) but feel free to use whatever audio editor you want.

Open your song in Audacity and create a new track. Go to the top -> Generate -> Rhythm Track. In the Tempo (bpm), change it to the song BPM. If you don't know, use a tap the bpm website and figure out.

Then, create space in the track and head to the top - Generate - Silence. Generate around 15-30 seconds of silence. Move the song and the silence next to each other.

Now, you need to line up the 2nd beat to the first downbeat of the song. You can zoom in holding Alt to get really close line it up perfectly.

Then, delete the silence in the beginning so the rhythm track is at the start. After it is lined up with your song, you can now delete the rhythm track and export as a **WAV or OGG**. Do not use MP4

If done correctly, you should now have a measure of silence into the start of your song. It should be timed perfectly so no need to mess with offset.
