# Getting Started

This guide assumes you already know what Sound Voltex is or are interested in
playing it. If you have no clue what it is about, it is
recommended to check out [Leviern's GDQ showcase of
SDVX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NePZzIFKW_s).

To start, choose how you want to play. If you are new and have no clue, it is
recommended to head to an [arcade](/setup/arcade). 

If you don't have access to an arcade, your next best option is [Konasute (コナ
ステ)](/setup/konasute) which requires a monthly fee. Otherwise, there are
[simulators](/setup/simulators) which are free.
