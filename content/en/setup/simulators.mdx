## Intro
By nature, simulators do not offer the official experience but are free to play and allow you to play both [converts](/terminology/termsandvocab#convert) and user-created charts (referred to as [customs](/terminology/termsandvocab#custom)).

There are two SDVX simulators: Unnamed SDVX clone (USC) and K-Shoot MANIA (KSM). Both simulators can play the same charts but are overall much different in terms of features.

## Unnamed SDVX clone (USC)

**\+** [ARS/Backup Gauge support](/compendium/gauge-options#alternative-rate-system-ars)\

### Setup [#usc-setup]

[Download Page](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone/releases/)

Extract the contents to a folder on your computer and run `usc-game.exe` inside. Any charts that you download (see [here](#getting-charts) for where to find them) should be placed in the `songs` folder that is created upon running the game for the first time.

Before you start playing, there are settings you should adjust:

<Image src="/setup/simulators/usc_settings_1.png" alt="usc settings 1" />

In the `Input` tab, set `Button input mode` and `Laser input mode` to the input device you are using. Then, click the buttons above to modify your bindings.
<br/>

<Image src="/setup/simulators/usc_settings_2.png" alt="usc settings 2" />

In the `Game` tab, set `Speed mod type` to `MMod` and adjust `ModSpeed`. For new players, any speed between 300-400 is recommended.
<br/>

In the `Skin` tab you can enable any skins you have installed and adjust any skin-specific settings.

Once that's all done, you're ready to play! Here are some keybinds that you may find useful:
  - During song select:
    - `Tab` to search for songs
    - `F2` to select a random song
    - `FX-L` to filter by folder, press `START` while this menu is open to filter by level
    - `FX-L + FX-R` to open the game settings menu
    - `BT-B + BT-C` to open the collections menu
  - `F5` during gameplay to quickly restart
  - `F12` during results to take a screenshot

### Skins [#usc-skins]

Besides the default skin, those listed below are the only up-to-date skins that should be used.

For installing skins, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqxcwzge06I). Even though the video is for Nightfall specifically, the process is the same for any other skin.

| Name | Description | Download | Showcase |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- | -------- |
| Nightfall | A minimal but highly customizable skin that includes many features not available in the base game. | [Link](https://github.com/Hoshikara/Nightfall) | [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVazaZcb15A) |
| LiqidWave | A skin that copies the visuals of SOUND VOLTEX VIVID WAVE. | [Link](https://cdn.oniichan.wtf/file/oniichan-wtf-files/skins/LiqidWave-1.5.0-memory-leak-fix.zip) | [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nku9ljDsWA) |
| HeavenlyExpress | A skin that copies the visuals of SOUND VOLTEX IV HEAVENLY HAVEN. | [Link](https://mega.nz/file/GYMH0KQa#zkMr0-YWaTiNImbmAwzxRC6b5DYQoZGsy16BIDsq8OA)| [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG5goZG9BL4) |


## K-Shoot MANIA (KSM)

<Image src="/setup/simulators/ksm_preview.png" alt="ksm preview" />

[Home page](https://www.kshootmania.com/en/)

### Pros & Cons [#ksm-pros-cons]
**\+** Camera and sound effects work as intended\
**\+** Online leaderboards (for custom charts only)\
**\-** Poor performance\
**\-** Lasers are not accurate (but still arguably better than USC)\
**\-** Limited resolution options\
**\-** No portrait gameplay support\
**\-** No song search\
**\-** Windows only

### Setup [#ksm-setup]

[Download Page](https://www.kshootmania.com/en/download.html)

Extract the contents to a folder on your computer and run `kshootmania.exe` inside. Any charts that you download (see [here](#getting-charts) for where to find them) should be placed in the `songs` folder.

Before you start playing, enter `OPTION` and adjust these settings:

<Image src="/setup/simulators/ksm_settings_1.png" alt="ksm settings 1" />

In `DISPLAY / SOUND` settings:
- Set the `DISPLAY LANGUAGE` accordingly
- Set `BG (WHILE PLAYING)` to `Hide` to improve gameplay FPS
- Set `HIDE "ALL" FOLDER` to `On` to improve song select performance
<br/>

<Image src="/setup/simulators/ksm_settings_2.png" alt="ksm settings 2" />

In `INPUT / JUDGEMENT` settings:
- Set `INPUT TYPE OF LASER OBJECT` to `Hold key` if you are playing on keyboard, or see [this guide](/guides/ksm-controller-setup) if you are playing with a controller
- Make sure `ASSIST TICK` is set to `On`; this setting is bugged and works the opposite way (on is off and off is on)

Return to the title screen and select `START`. Note that you will be prompted to sign in to the internet ranking system every time.
<br/>

Hold down `BT-D` to bring up the `Hispeed` menu and then press your left or right arrow key to switch to a fixed number setting. For new players, any speed between 300-400 is recommended.

Once that's all done, you're ready to play! Here are some keybinds that you may find useful:
  - During song select:
    - `FX-L + FX-R` to toggle between alphabetical and level sort
    - `FX-L` or `FX-R` to jump to the next or previous letter or level in the current folder
    - Any `BT` for various gameplay settings
    - Any `BT` and `FX-L` or `FX-R` to jump to the start or end of the current folder

    - Hold `START` to add or remove favorites
  - Any 3 `BT` and `START` to quickly exit gameplay

More skins can be found at the [KSM subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/kshootmania/wiki/skins) but their download links may be dead.

To install a skin, make sure KSM is closed and follow these steps within your KSM folder:
  1. Make a backup of your `imgs` and `se` folders
  2. Extract in the `imgs` and `se` folders the skin provides and accept all replacements
  3. Delete your `cache` folder

## Which one should I play?

After reviewing the pros and cons of each simulator, you might be thinking "why would anyone play KSM?". For those that do choose to play KSM over USC, they believe the gameplay engine simply feels better and in the end that's what matters. However, these tend to be either more experienced players that can pick up on the differences or older players who are simply too used to KSM after playing it for so long.

For newer players, it is recommended to play USC for all the features it offers over KSM. But don't forget these simulators are free to play, so it doesn't hurt to try both and see which one you prefer.

For those looking to play custom charts (namely [Insane KSM](/compendium/insane-ksm)), it is recommended to play KSM. Even though custom charts can also be played in USC, nearly all of them are created with the camera and effects of KSM in mind.

## Getting Charts

Converts can be found here:
  - [SDVX 1-5](https://git.magiruuvelvet.gdn/sdvx/sdvx-charts/src/branch/master/songs), click `â‹¯` in the top right and then `Download ZIP`
    - This pack contains most but not all SDVX 5 charts, more can be found [here](https://mega.nz/folder/RGBHlC6S#fbm3n3HfFAHGDQdADMgOnQ)
  - [SDVX EG (6)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S8gj7-waR4o4o7gU_NZtR3VmsD8UY4ho), click `Download all` in the top right

Note that converts in the SDVX EG and alternate SDVX 5 packs are mostly missing their lower difficulties as converting charts is a manual and time-consuming process carried out by volunteers.

Custom charts can be found at [ksm.dev](https://ksm.dev/). A few things to note:
  - This site is for **custom charts only**, convert uploads are not allowed and cannot be found here
  - There is no guarantee of chart quality; users are free to upload whatever chart they create
  - Full difficulty spreads *can* be found, but most customs skew towards higher levels as their creators are usually more skilled at/dedicated to the game
  - Chart levels are set by feel, not by some fixed formula, so there may be cases where a custom feels easier or harder than the level indicates

To install charts, extract and place them in the `songs` folder of your USC/KSM installation. For converts or custom song packs, do not remove them from the base folders they are in as they are used for organization in-game e.g. if you wanted to install the chart for `Butterfly Twist`, the path should look like this:
  - `/kshootmania/songs/SOUND VOLTEX V VIVID WAVE/butterfly_twist`

and not like this:
  - `/kshootmania/songs/butterfly_twist`

KSM also supports subfolders to further organize songs but USC does not.
