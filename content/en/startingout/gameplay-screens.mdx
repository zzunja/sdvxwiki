## Song Select
When starting the game, you will be brought to song selection. Song selection is where you select the chart you would like to play.

Move vertically through the charts with the `VOL-R` knob. Change the difficulty of the chart with `VOL-L`. Pressing start will select the song you are hovering.

Here you can also select what difficulty you want to set the chart as. Change the difficulty with `VOL-L`. You can also see what gauge you are using as well as if you are using mirror, random, or S-RAN. Press start to begin the chart.

### Sorting [#song-select-sorting]

Pressing `FX-R` (right) will open the sorting menu. Here is a general translation of what everything
means.

<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/Sort.png" className="w-100"/>

These sorts apply to the folder you select. So, if you select `Score Grade` and go into the `LEVEL 17` folder, you will see all level 17s sorted by your score.

### Folders [#song-select-folders]
<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/folders.png"/>

Folders allow you to sort through songs more easily.
- **xè¡Œ** will sort by the hiragana of the song
- **Score Grade** will sort by your grades on charts
- **ALMOST** will show charts that you're about to reach the next grade threshold
- **Clear Mark** will sort by your clear on charts
- **Search by Genre** will sort charts into genres
- **Search by Contest** will search charts by contest. These are KAC, BPL, and other contests they do
- **Search by Version** will search by each version of the game. Booth, Infinite Infection, Gravity Wars etc.
- **Released** will be sorted by release date. Top is the oldest, bottom is the newest.
- **SKILL LEVEL** will be songs from the [Dan Courses](/compendium/dan-courses)
- **Favorites** will be sorted by your favorites. Can hold up to 50 songs.
- **VOLFORCE** will sort by what is in your best 50. This does not sort by what is giving you the highest VF, but rather by what sorting mode you are currently on.
- **EFFECT RADAR** will sort charts by what their highest part of the radar is. More information about radar on the [Radar page](/compendium/effect-radar)
- **PLAYER RADAR** will sort by what's on your player radar.
- **BLASTER GATE, HEXADIVER**. This is the Blaster Gate, Omega Dimension, and HEXADIVER folders. Note that the first HEXADIVER has multiple HEXADIVERS in it. You will only see BLASTER GATE on Konasute.

### Controls [#song-select-controls]
- Pressing both `FX` buttons will open the options menu. See more about options on the [Options page.](/startingout/options)
- Pressing `FX-L` will close the current open folder. 
- Holding `FX-L` or `FX-R` and scrolling will scroll through the sorting you have. 
- When hovering over a song, you can press `0` to favorite it. This will add it to a separate folder. You can have up to 50 songs favorited.
- Pressing `8` while on this screen will open the Rival leaderboard and Location/National best Leaderboard. 
- Pressing `3` will choose a random chart in the folder selected.
- If in premium time, Pressing all the `BT` buttons will give you the option to leave premium time.


## Matching
After selecting a song, you will go into matching. This is where you can match with other players playing the same song. Note that these players don't have to be playing the same difficulty to match together.

Pressing both FX buttons at the same time will send a request to skip. If you have other players in your lobby, you will have to wait for either everyone to skip or the time to run out.

You can also adjust your lane speed here by holding `START` and moving either knob.

On Konasute or Premium Time, you will not enter the matching screen and will go straight to the chart.

### Controls [#matching-controls]
- Pressing both `FX` at the same time will skip.
- Holding `START` and moving either knob will change lane speed
- Double tapping and holding `START` will allow for finer control of lane speed.

## Main Gameplay
When you load into a song, you will be greeted with this screen. This is where you will play the chart you selected.

<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/ingame.jpg" className="w-100"/>


- **Title, Cover, and difficulty of song:** Shows current information about what you are currently playing. Bar below title is the progress bar. 
<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/title.png" className="h-60"/>

- **Current BPM and current lane speed:** Shows lane speed, Current BPM, Offsets, and locked lane speed if on Konasute. If the chart changes BPM, it will be displayed here with what lane speed it is changing to.
<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/bpm-and-lanespeed.png" className="h-100"/>

- **Your profile data:** Shows current crew member, appeal card, rank, dan, volforce, and other things depending on what you have. If you are matching or have target score on, this will also show the difference in score.
<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/player-profile.png" className="h-100"/>
- **Challenge and quick retry:** Only appears during premium time or on Konasute. Shows the current challenge set. Pressing `00` on the numpad will enable auto-quick retry, making it so that the moment you fail out, you will automatically
 retry.
<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/challenge.png" className="h-100"/>
- **Current score, EX SCORE, and highest chain you have had:** If you are using
 EX SCORE, this will look slightly different. See below for the difference
<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/scoredifference.png" />

See [here](/startingout/scoring#ex-score) to learn more about EX SCORE.

- **Life Gauge:** This is your gauge. It might look different depending on your
 settings. To learn more about gauge, see [Gauge Options](/compendium/gauge-options) page.
<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/gauge.png" className="w-40"/>

### Controls [#main-gameplay-controls]
- Pressing `00` on the numpad will toggle quick retry
- Holding `START` and moving either knob will change lane speed
- Double tapping and holding `START` will allow for finer control of lane speed.

## Results

<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/scoreScreen.jpg" className="w-120"/>

1. **What the challenge was and how many quick retries you did:** Only counts quick
 retries that happened during the score. So if you fully backed out and saw
 the score screen, it reset. Only seen on premium time or Konasute
<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/quick-retry.png" className="w-80"/>
2. **Title, Score, compare to personal best, and Ex-Score:** Shows your score compared to personal best and your Ex-Score. If you were using
 Ex-Score this would look slightly different. 
<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/clear-title.png" className="w-100"/>
3. **S-Crit, Crit, Near, and Error count:** Shows you how many S-Crits, Crits,
 Nears, and Errors you got. `CHIP` means note, `HOLD` means hold/long notes,
 and `TSUMAMI` means laser. Note that only chips have crit or nears.
<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/count.png" className="w-100"/>
4. **Profile:** If you gained Volforce, it will pop up at the bottom next to your
 Volforce. If you are playing at an Arcade, the stars at the bottom will also
 show what current arcade you are at. Each star represents how many scores you
 hold at your arcade currently. 1 star means you have at least one top score
 at your arcade, 3 is you have the most, and 2 is somewhere in between (does
 not mean 2nd most).
<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/profile-after.png" className="w-110"/>
5. **Spread of Accuracy:** Shows you details about how late or early you were. For example, this screenshot shows I hit 4 nears early and 10 nears late. Generally, you want this to be as even as possible, but depending
 on a lot of factors, it might sway one side or the other.
<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/spread.png" className="w-100"/>
6. **Blaster gauge:** Shows you your current blaster gauge percentage or varient gauge percentage.
<Image src="/startingout/gameplay-screens/blaster.png" className="w-100"/>

Note that this was a screenshot from Konasute, so things will look slightly different if you are at the arcade.
