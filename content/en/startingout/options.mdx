## Options
While on the song select screen, pressing `FX-L` and `FX-R` will bring up the
options menu. All settings are also accessible through the Touchscreen menu, which can be accessed by pressing `F1` on Konasute. This
guide will go over all the options, what they do, and recommended settings.

This will go over the menu that is shown when pressing `FX-L` and `FX-R`, so the layout might be different. The explanations are the same.

### Lane Speed
<Image src="/startingout/options/LaneSpeed.png"/>

Lane Speed is how fast the notes take to reach the bottom of the screen from when they appear. This setting goes from 1-10 with two decimal places. 

Lane speed is not how fast the chart is. If you play `1.00` lane speed you are playing the same chart and same speed as someone playing at `10.00` lane speed. Lane speed is just visual. For a demonstration of this, see the video below.

<Video src="/startingout/options/lanespeedcomparision.webm"/>
<div className="flex justify-center">
<em>From left to right, [JiminP 1.00 Lane Speed,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjY1itUxA0s) [DDX 6.90 Lane Speed,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HewBZrjtuDU) and [Mini 9.50 Lane Speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLjAC0NUJAg)</em>
</div>

Even though they look different, they are playing the same chart. It isn't a "faster" or "slower" chart. 

In the beginning, you will likely start around 2-4. As your reading skill gets better you will generally start to increase this to make things easier to read. 

Pressing `Numpad 6` will lock your lane speed. This will make it so that every time you start the game or go to song select, your lane speed will set back to what you have it locked to.

#### Theory
In general, 
<div className="text-center mt-3">
**The higher the lane speed = The fewer notes on the screen = The easier it is to read**
</div>
**However**, you don't want to increase it to the point where you are reacting and not reading. 

Lane speed is preference. While in theory, you should push it higher, this
doesn't matter if you are unable to read high lane speeds. Some people read
9+ lane speed while others stay between 6 to 8. How fast you can read is
dependent on a lot of different factors.


### Offset
<Image src="/startingout/options/Offset.png"/>

There are 2 offsets. Draw (`判定タイミング(描画)`) and Judge (`判定タイミング(音)`). Draw is visual offset and Judge is audio offset.
Draw moves the judgment line either up (+) or down (-). It doesn't do this
visually, the judgment line will still look like it's in the same spot but it has moved. Here is a visualization of Draw Offset

<Image src="/startingout/options/draw-example.png" className="w-100"/>

The line at the top would represent where the judgment line would be heading to
for `+` draw. The bottom line would represent where the judgment line would be
heading to for `-` draw. The line in between is the default judgment line.

Judge adds an offset to the music.

You can press the following numpad button to change the offset:
- `8`: Judge +
- `2`: Judge -
- `9`: Draw +
- `3`: Draw -

If you are on a Valkyrie Cabinet, pressing the offset number on the touchscreen will change it to ms. Pressing `6` will also do this on Konasute.

#### Theory

Your offset can sometimes change day-to-day setup-to-setup chart-to-chart. Sometimes, you have to decide whether to change offset or your own internal timing.

An important thing to note is that a lot of times it isn't your offset but
rather your lane speed/reading ability. If you notice you are hitting a lot of
lates or earlies, you might be playing a chart that is difficult for you to read
or your lane speed is wrong. 

If you are having trouble finding your offset or just want to learn more about offset [here is JiminP guide.](https://r-g.kr/article/sync) This is a very detailed guide for all your offset needs.

### Early Late adjustment
<Image src="/startingout/options/Earlylate.png"/>

The next 3 are adjustments to the early late or ms that show up when you press something off-timing. 

<Image src="/startingout/options/Earlyexample.png"/>

The first one adjusts when the early/late shows up. (Pictured above) Critical will make it so that every time you hit a crit or below it will show up. Near will make it so only nears and below it will show up. Off means it never shows up.

<Image src="/startingout/options/msexmaple.png"/>
The second one adjusts when the ms shows up. (Pictured above) All will show it for everything, even S-Crit. Note that if you hit a S-Crit, it will be grey. Critical will make it so that every time you hit a Crit or below it will show up. Near will make it so only Nears and below it will show up. Off means it never shows up.

The final option adjust where they show up on the screen. Upper is most common.

In general, it is a good idea to have one of them only show up for nears and the
other show up for all or just crits. That way you know if you hit a nearby if one shows up.

### S-Critical
<Image src="/startingout/options/SCrit.png"/>

This adds an extra judgment that is stricter than Crit. This does not affect normal scoring. For information on the timing, see [Timing Windows page](/compendium/timing-windows)

Note that if you are using light start this will not be accessible. This does not matter for Konasute. In general, it is recommended to always have this on if you can.

### Lane preview
<Image src="/startingout/options/Preview.png"/>
Here you can preview the changes you just made. It will play a simple chart with a simple song where you can see your lane speed, offsets, and early/late adjustments. It is recommend using this to figure out what you like.

### System Voice
<Image src="/startingout/options/SystemVoice.png"/>

You can choose to disable or enable the voice from your navigator that plays around the menus. For example, the voice that plays when you complete a chart.

### Show SDVX Konasute/Arcade scores
<Image src="/startingout/options/ShowScores.png"/>

This setting changes whether or not you can see your best scores overall from Arcade and Konasute. If enabled, it will combine your Arcade and Konasute scores and show you what you have the highest of. So, if you have a score of `9,978,132` on Konasute and a `9,942,612` on Arcade, it will display the Konasute score.

Note that Volforce and the actual score are separate between the two. 

You can tell which scores are from Konasute or Arcade by if this light at the
the top is lit.

<Image src="/startingout/options/ShowKonasuteScores.png"/>
Here it shows that this score was from the arcade because the Arcade is lit up.

If you don't have your Konasute and Arcade data linked, this option will not show up.

### Valkyrie Effect
<Image src="/startingout/options/ValkyrieEffect.png"/>

This changes how the lasers look. Enabling it adds a bit more effect to lasers. For an example, see the video below.

<Video src="/startingout/options/valkeffect.mp4"/>
<em className="flex justify-center">[Inevitable Magic MXM 18](https://sdvx.in/06/06450m.htm)</em>

### Early Late Color
<Image src="/startingout/options/Earlylateflip.png"/>

This flips the early and late colors. Normally, Late are blue and Early is pink/red. This flips them. 

### Laser Colors
<Image src="/startingout/options/lasercolors.png"/>

These change the laser colors. The first one is the left laser and the second one is the right laser. Most people don't change these. Although notably Mini has his left laser (Normally blue) as green.

### Display Brightness
<Image src="/startingout/options/displaybrightness.png"/>

This is how bright the background is. If you want a good example, look at the Lane Speed video above. Mini plays on a brighter background compared to JiminP and DDX.

### Score Difference
<Image src="/startingout/options/scoredifference.png" className="w-50"/>
If you are in matching or have [Target Score](#target-score) on, this will show
the difference in score between you and your opponent/target score. Example below.
<Image src="/startingout/options/scoredifference-example.png" className="w-100"/>

Note that Target Score takes over opponent, so if you have Target Score on and you are
matching, you will see your Target Score difference instead of opponent
difference.

### Normal Scoring and Ex Scoring
<Image src="/startingout/options/normalscoreexscore.png"/>

This switches between Normal Scoring and EX-Scoring. Normal Scoring is the score
that is graded and used for Volforce. It has a max of 10,000,000 on every chart
and is based on Crit, Nears, and errors. EX-Scoring is based on S-Crits, Crits,
Nears, and Errors. See [here](/startingout/scoring) to learn more about scoring.

Ex-Score will not be available if you have S-Crits disabled.

Even if you use EX-score, your normal score is still calculated and same vice
versa (as long as you have s-crits enabled). You can see your EX-Score right
under your score on any chart.

If you are just starting, it is recommended to keep Normal Scoring.

### Random and Mirror
<Image src="/startingout/options/RandomMirror.png"/>

This changes how the chart is.
- Mirror flips the chart. For example, a chart that is normally a 1-2-3-4 staircase is now a 4-3-2-1 staircase.
- Random randomizes the lanes the notes come down. For example, a 1-2-3-4 staircase now can become 3-2-4-1.
- S-Random completely randomizes the notes as well, so any note can be anything

<Video src="/startingout/options/normalran.mp4"/>

In general, Mirror is the only useable option. Random and S-Ran often make charts have [illegal patterns](/terminology/patterns#illegal).

### Effective/Excessive Clear
<Image src="/startingout/options/ClearType.png"/>

These are the clear type options.

- **Effective Rate:** Start at 0% and work up to above 70% gauge to clear
- **Excessive Rate:** Start at 100% and survive the whole chart without it dropping to 0 to clear. Errors take more off the gauge and are harder to build up compared to Effective.
- **Excessive + ARS:** Starts Excessive Rate and if you fail out of Excessive, then go to Effective. Your Effective Gauge is still calculated as you play so you won't start at 0% if you die in Excessive.

Clear type will affect your Volforce. Excessive is harder so it is worth more Volforce. 

Excessive + ARS is not available on light start. This does not matter if you play Konasute. 

In general, you should always play with Excessive + ARS if you have the option. 

For more information on Gauge, see [Gauge Options page.](/compendium/gauge-options)

### Volume
<Image src="/startingout/options/audiolevels.png"/>

This is Volume. If you are playing on Konasute, this will be the game
volume (like in the screenshot). If you are at an arcade, this will be headset
volume. If you don't have a headset plugged in at the arcade this will do
nothing. 

### Challenge Options
<Image src="/startingout/options/challenge.png"/>

These are the challenge options. During a run, if you fall below the
point to get the grade that you have selected you will automatically fail out.
For example, if I selected UC and I missed a note, it would auto-fail me out. 

### Target Score
<Image src="/startingout/options/target-score.png" className="w-50"/>

This is your target score. You can set what you would like to target. It will then show the difference of that score while playing so you can know how close or far you are from it.

This will not show if you have [Score Difference](#score-difference) turned off.

## Additional things to note

Most of these settings are completely preference. There are general recommended settings but nothing is concrete. Try out things and see if you like them. 

Not all Valkyrie settings are on Konasute, and not all Konasute settings are on Valkyrie.
