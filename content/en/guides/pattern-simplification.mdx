## Wiggling
<Image src="/guides/specific-pattern-cheese/wiggleing.gif"/>
Wiggling refers to rapidly moving the knob from left to right, abusing the leniency of how the game handle inputs for laser. Specifically, the game allows laser input to go off-direction briefly before being counted as an error. Therefore, wiggling at a faster rate reduces the brief period of time where your laser input goes off-track, increasing the chance of avoiding any errors.

## Anmitsu 
Anmitsu is a way of simplifying note patterns into sequence of chords by intentionally hitting them earlier or later. This is done by abusing the timing window in voltex. This is similar to "manip" in other rhythm games like Osu Mania. 

While sometimes you can Anmitsu for all crit, it is more common to get nears during Anmitsu. The technique is therefore often utilized to achieve Ultimate Chain clear medal or clear songs.

There is a [Anmitsu calculator](https://kattrxvjxxde.github.io/an32_checker/)
that can tell you by how much margin you have to hit and get a crit or a near
depending on the chart. You can enter the BPM and the [dividing
notes](/en/terminology/termsandvocab#n-th-notes) (16th, 24th, etc.) and see where
you need to press and how much time you have.

### General Patterns

#### Fast Trills
<Video src="/guides/specific-pattern-cheese/fasttrills.mp4"
        vertical={true}
        size="max-w-md"
/>
Some fast [24th](/terminology/termsandvocab#n-th-notes) trills can be treated as 12th jacks.

#### Triple Stairs
<Image src="/guides/specific-pattern-cheese/triples.png"/>

In this example, you can group every 2 notes in each triplet to make the pattern a chord trill.

<em className="flex justify-center">Pattern on the left, how to play on the right.</em>

It is important to note that it is better to chord it with outwards instead of inwards. Meaning, you should chord the last 2 notes not the first 2. For a deeper explanation see [Mini Note.](https://note.com/mini208/n/n3d77e9743e68)

Another example includes [I MXM 20](https://sdvx.in/04/04238m.htm).

#### Xronièr MXM 20 

##### Intro and Outro
<Image src="/guides/specific-pattern-cheese/xronier.png"/>
This pattern can be simplified in two ways. For a UC with a good amount of nears, you can do this.
<Image src="/guides/specific-pattern-cheese/xronier_uc_cheese.png"/>
Alternatively, for a full critical method, you can do this.

##### FX BT Chords
<Image src="/guides/specific-pattern-cheese/xronierchords.png"/>
This specific chord can be hit like this to achieve Ultimate Chain.

## Miscellaneous

### Spaced Out Chords
<Image src="/guides/specific-pattern-cheese/space_chords.png"/>
Generally most spaced out chords can be hit by mashing all 6 buttons. The distance between each chord prevents the players from getting early errors.

<p className="text-lg font-bold">Example Charts</p>
- [BEAST BASS BOMB MXM 18](https://sdvx.in/04/04187m.htm) Measures 1-11
- [Fire Storm MXM 18](https://sdvx.in/03/03167e.htm) Measures 1-6
