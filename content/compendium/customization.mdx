# Customization
<Callout>
    Unless said otherwise, most stuff in here is arcade-exclusive.
</Callout>
There exist a lot of ways to customize your game. You can change the Crew, BGM,
Background, Touchscreen Background, NEMSYS controller, and stickers. Most of
these are obtained through gacha. You can sometimes get certain crews through
events and the arena shop though. To customize everything besides crew, you can
head [here](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/sdvx/vi/playdata/customize/index.html).

## Rolling
### Online Rolling
You can roll online for stuff through the e-amusement shop. This cost real
money. You can get Navs, BGMs, Stickers, etc through these. Note that only navs
are useable on Konasute コナステ. You can see all of them 
[here](https://p.eagate.573.jp/gate/p/eamusement/coop/mall.html?fromlist&dt=%2FSOUND%20VOLTEX%2F)

Online gacha is not like other gacha where there is a pity system. You can't get the same item twice.

To see what's in all the packs, you can head
[here](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/sdvx/vi/pregene/index.html?series_id=1) or
click on the pack you want to click and click the `こちら` link in the
description. To roll, you must enter your password first.

### Valkyrie Rolling
Not to be confused with the online valkyrie rolling, this is an in-game rolling
system that is only available outside the US. If you are in the US, you have to get someone who has access to valkyrie rolling to get them.

Most new generators that come out are now done online. 

### Card Connect
Card connect is how to roll for older navs. These can only be done at nemsys cabs, which only exist in regions outside of Japan and America as of now. These **don't** have a pity system and you **can** get duplicates. 

These gacha print out small cards as well. You can see these [here.](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/card_connect/1/gacha/sdvx.html)


## Events
Rarely, they will do events for navs. Often this is usually an arena shop where you can buy older navs. Sometimes, they also do other events for navs, but this is rare.
