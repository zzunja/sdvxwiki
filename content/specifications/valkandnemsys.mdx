While that NEMSYS is currently running Vivid Wave, it would still look the same
as a Exceed Gear NEMSYS.

Throughout the years, small changes are done to cabs. While nothing drastic, if
you notice something slightly off, it could be a older or newer model then the
images above.



## Differences
Valkyrie Models have:
- 120hz screen
- 43" Monitor
- 22" Touch Screen
- Better knob assembly
- S-Crit Window
- Valkyrie exclusive songs
- Valkyrie exclusive settings
- Deck is much bigger

NEMSYS Cabs have:
- 60hz Screen 32"
- Worse knob assembly
- Worse PC causing lag with some Live2D and effects. Noteably Akasha
- Has access to Card Generator and Card Connect.

Generally, if you want a better experience, use a Valkyrie cab if possible.
Sometimes Valkyrie cabs can be more expensive, but generally they are the same
price. With the exception of Card Generator, everything the NEMSYS cab can do
the Valkyrie cab can do better.

## Notes
As of 2023, NEMSYS cabs in America and Japan have been phased out. This means
that NEMSYS cabs on the `J` region are non-functional. For Korea and other Asia
regions, NEMSYS cabs still operate. It is unknown if KONAMI plans to permanently
phase out NEMSYS cabs.

NEMSYS Cabs are the only way to access Card Generator and Card Connect. The
printer does not connect with Valkyrie cabs. If you want a Card Connect
navigator, you have to use a NEMSYS.
