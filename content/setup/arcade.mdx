# Arcade

## Finding an SDVX cabinet

By far the cheapest and most convenient way (depending on where you live) to play is at
an arcade

#### For US players

[Round1](https://www.round1usa.com/) arcades are the only arcades where you can play SDVX on official servers. Check out their locations and if you live by one you can go and get an e-amusement pass and officially play SDVX.

#### For everyone else

Arcades with offline cabs or cabs running on unofficial servers are your only option. To find nearby arcades, go
to [zenius-i-vanisher](https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/arcades.php), select SOUND
VOLTEX, and look at your area.

![Zenius Search](/arcade/zenius.png)

Your search should look like something like this. First check for `SOUND VOLTEX EXCEED GEAR (Valkyrie Model)` and if there is nothing select `SOUND VOLTEX EXCEED GEAR.`.

## Playing on the arcade for the first time

### Get an e-amusement card

E-Amusement cards are used to save your play data and can be used for other games outside of SDVX as well.
If you are at Round1 or select arcades, you can purchase an e-amusement card at the front desk.

<div className="flex items-center justify-center mt-3">
  ![eamusement](/arcade/eamusementcard.png)
</div>

They look something like this and cost about $5-$10. Try to get one with the
Amusement IC logo shown on the bottom left of the card. Most cards have this logo as
the older ones have mostly been phased out. If you can't purchase an e-amusement card, any card with this logo on it will work such as Aime, Banapass and NESiCA.

## Creating an account

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you have played Konasute it is **HIGHLY** recommended to transfer your
  Konasute data to that card instead of new creating data on the card. You will
  not be able to combine your Konasute data with your arcade data if the card
  already has data. You can find more information about how to link in the
  [Konasute コナスデ](/konasute) section.

Once you have your e-amusement card, head over to the SDVX arcade and tap your card on the pad. You will then be prompted to create a profile.

## Creating a profile and playing your first credit

<Callout>
  A lot of information here is coming from [this
  guide](https://voltexes.com/arcade-quick-start-guide-eg/). If you are lost,
  it is recommend checking out their guide.

After you scan your card, you will have to create your profile.

![start1](/arcade/start1.jpg)

You will be asked to either transfer data or create new data. Simply create new data since you don't have data to transfer.

![start2](/arcade/start2.jpg)

You will then create a PIN. This PIN will also be used in all other Bemani games that you play.

![start3](/arcade/start3.jpg)

You will then create your name. Use the knobs to scroll and press start to
select a character. Once you have the name you want, scroll to the end
button and finish making your profile.

After you create your profile, there will be a lot of options available. For
just getting started select `NORMAL` then `STANDARD START`. If `STANDARD START` isn't
available, select `LIGHT START`. `STANDARD START` is better as it lets you use S-CRIT,
ARS, and removes level restrictions among other things. For more information on what
all those things are you can find out [here](/compendium/gamemodes#normal).

Once you choose a mode, you will be in your room. Here you can change your crew,
appeal card, see tama adventure, and if arena shop is open see that. You can
still select a character though. You can also change your appeal card. Finally
you can select start and begin your credit.
