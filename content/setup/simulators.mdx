## Intro
By nature, simulators do not offer the official experience but are free to play and allow you to play both [converts](/terminology/termsandvocab#convert) and user-created charts (referred to as [customs](/terminology/termsandvocab#custom)).

There are two SDVX simulators: Unnamed SDVX clone (USC) and K-Shoot MANIA (KSM). Both simulators can play the same charts but much are different overall in terms of features.


## [Unnamed SDVX clone (USC)](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone)

### Pros
- ARS/Backup Gauge support
- Excellent performance
- More intuitive song sorting and filtering
- Online leaderboards (for converts only)
- Playable on Windows/macOS/Linux
- Portrait gameplay support
- Practice mode
- Replay system

### Cons
- Camera effects may not behave properly
- Effects may not sound as intended
- Lasers are not accurate

### Setup

[Download Page](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone/releases/)

Simply extract the contents to a folder on your computer and run `usc-game.exe` inside. Charts and skins that you download should be placed in the `songs` and `skins` folders, respectively.

### Skins

Besides the default skin, those listed below are the only up-to-date skins that should be used.

For installing skins, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqxcwzge06I). Even though the video is for Nightfall specifically, the process is the same for any other skin.

| Name | Description | Download | Showcase |
|--|--|--|--|
| Nightfall | A minimal but highly customizable skin that includes many features not available in the base game. | [Link](https://github.com/Hoshikara/Nightfall) | [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVazaZcb15A) |
| LiqidWave | A skin that copies the visuals of SOUND VOLTEX VIVID WAVE. | [Link](https://cdn.oniichan.wtf/file/oniichan-wtf-files/skins/LiqidWave-1.5.0-memory-leak-fix.zip)|[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nku9ljDsWA)|
|HeavenlyExpress|A skin that copies the visuals of SOUND VOLTEX IV HEAVENLY HAVEN.|[Link](https://mega.nz/file/GYMH0KQa#zkMr0-YWaTiNImbmAwzxRC6b5DYQoZGsy16BIDsq8OA)|[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG5goZG9BL4)|


### Options

Press the Settings button on the main screen to take you to the settings. Some important things to change are:

- **Input:** Set up your controls here. If you are using a controller, set it to gamepad mode (one without a mouse) and use a controller for both input modes. It is also recommended to calibrate your laser sensitivity.
- **Game:** Set Speed mod type to MMod. This is the same as used in official SDVX. You can set your lane speed here if you want, or change it during gameplay.
- **Skin:** Select your skin. Depending on the skin it might have some additional settings for you to configure.

## [K-Shoot MANIA (KSM)](https://www.kshootmania.com/en/)

### Pros
- Camera and sound effects work as intended
- Online leaderboards (for custom charts only)

### Cons
- Poor performance
- Lasers are not accurate (but still arguably better than USC)
- Limited resolution options
- No portrait gameplay support
- No song search
- Windows only

### Setup

[Download Page](https://www.kshootmania.com/en/download.html)


Unzip it to a folder you like and open `kshootmania.exe`. Head to settings and select input settings. Change it to what you would like. If you are using a FauceTwo, it is recommended to follow [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_xumGVMSXAdeslJz_e8pyn7eALaT33WgEgSbiKrib9s) guide on how to set up your inputs. Otherwise, you can put charts in the songs folder and start playing.

KSM can link to your Twitter account to access the online leaderboard, but it isn't needed and is mostly dead. It will ask you this every time you go to your songs.

To change Hi-Speed, hold BT-D and press the up and down arrows if you are on song select. In the game just press the arrows. If you are stuck on a multiplier, press the left or right arrow keys to select the number. The number is out of 1000, but 1000 is the same as 10.00 lane speed. (900 is 9.0, 850 is 8.5, etc.)

### Skins

There are also KSM skins, but they are generally harder to find. A lot of them are really old and some are in Japanese only. Some download links are also lost to time. You can maybe find some [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kshootmania/wiki/skins/).

To install a skin, backup your **imgs** and **se** folders. This is your default skin. It is recommended to back this up in case something goes wrong; alternatively, you can also just redownload KSM to get it back. After this, extract the skin into the root of your folder and replace anything that needs to be replaced. This will install the skin for you.

## Which one should I play?

After reviewing the pros and cons of each simulator, you might be thinking "why would anyone play KSM?". For those that do choose to play KSM over USC, they believe the gameplay engine simply feels better and in the end that's what matters. However, these tend to be either more experienced players that can pick up on the differences or older players who are simply too used to KSM after playing it for so long.

For newer players, it is recommended to play USC for all the features it offers over KSM. But don't forget these simulators are free to play, so it doesn't hurt to try both and see which one you prefer.

## Charts

To find custom made charts, you can head to [ksm.dev](https://ksm.dev/). While they can definitely vary in quality, and a lot of them are higher level charts, it can be a good way of finding charts for songs you like.

You can also play converts. Older charts (from SDVX 1-5) can be found [here](https://gitlab.magiruuvelvet.gdn/magiruuvelvet/sdvx-charts/) and for recent charts (from SDVX 6), you can find them in [this Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S8gj7-waR4o4o7gU_NZtR3VmsD8UY4ho).

After downloading a chart, extract and place the folder in the songs folder. For example, `/USC/songs` is where I would put my songs. Do not remove the song folder from the folder that it comes in as songs are organized by the game version that they belong to.

You can also organize charts in folders. For example if you want all your downloaded charts in one folder, you can create a folder and place it in there. You can then sort by this folder in both USC and KSM.
USC doesn't support multi folder organization, i.e. for `/songs/NauticaDownloads/2024` USC wouldn't recognize the `2024` folder, but it can still see all the songs in that folder. KSM would recognize the `2024` folder and show it in game.
