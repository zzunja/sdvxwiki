# Playing and reading score

## Matching
If you are not in a premium time or using konasute, after selecting a song you
will start matching. This will automatically happen. If you don't want to
match/don't care you can skip it by pressing both of the fx buttons at the same
time.

## While in song
When you load into a song, you will be greeted with something that looks like this. While this looks like a lot, here is all the important stuff

<div className="flex items-center justify-center">
  <img src='/startingout/playing/ingame.jpg' width="400"/>
</div>

1. Title, Cover, and difficulty of song. Bar under the title is progress bar.
   Next to the cover it will also show what current track you are on if you are
   not on premium time.
2. Current BPM and current lane speed. If there is a BPM change, you will see
   what it is changing to and also what your lane speed is changing to here. If
   you are using an offset of any kind, it will also show that right under the
   lane speed where 8.60 in red currently is. To change lane speed while in the
   game, hold start and move the knob, pressing start twice and then holding
   will allow for finer control.
3. Your profile data. Shows current crew member, appeal card, rank, dan,
   volforce, and other things depending on what you have.
4. Shows current challenge and if you have auto quick retry on. Only appears on
   premium time or Konasute. Pressing 00 on the numpad will enable auto quick
   retry, making it so that the moment you fail out, you will automatically
   retry.
5. Current score, ex score, and highest chain you have had. If you are using
   ex-score, this will look slightly different. 
6. Gauge. This is you life bar. It might look different depending on what your
   settings are and how good you are doing.

## Score screen
<div className="flex items-center justify-center">
  <img src='/startingout/playing/scoreScreen.jpg' width="400"/>
</div>

1. What the challenge was and how many quick retries you did. Only counts quick
   retries that happened during the score. So if you fully backed out and saw
   the score screen, it reset. Only seen on premium or Konasute
2. Title, Score, compare to personal best, and ex score. If you were using
   ex-score this would look slightly different. More about score and how to read
   it farther down. 
3. S-Crit, Crit, Near, and Error count. Shows you how many S-Crits, Crits,
   Nears, and Errors you got for each. Chip means note, hold means hold notes,
   and tsunami means laser. Note that only chips have crit or nears.
4. Profile. If you gained Volforce, it will pop up at the bottom next to your
   Volforce. If you are playing at an Arcade, the stars at the bottom will also
   show what current arcade you are at. Each star represents how many scores you
   hold at your arcade currently. 1 star means you have at least one top score
   at your arcade, 3 is you have the most, and 2 is somewhere in between (does
   not mean 2nd most).
5. Overview of how accurate you were. For example, I hit 4 nears early and 10
   nears late. Generally you want this to be as even as possible, but depending
   on a lot of factors, it might sway one side or the other.
6. Blaster gauge. Shows you your current blaster gauge percentage. If you are at
   the arcade and not in premium time, it will also show you how close you are
   to an ex-track. After clearing 5 charts, you will get to play one extra stage
   after your third song.

Note that this was a screenshot from konasute, so things will look different if you are at the arcade. Generally, everything is in a similar spot though.

### What does your score mean?
<Callout>
Unless stated otherwise this is talking about normal scoring. Ex scoring differs a lot. Generally you should not care too much about your ex score in the beginning.
</Callout>

You can get a score between 0-10,000,000. A score of 10,000,000 means you got a perfect. This means you didn't hit any nears or errors. That is the highest score obtainable.

Your score is directly tied to the grade you get. For example, anything above 9,900,000 is an S. Here are all the grades you can get and what the score requirement is.
<br/>
<div className="flex items-center justify-center">

| Grade |  Score  |
|:-:|:-:| 
|  S  | > 9,900,000 |
| AAA+ | 9,899,999 - 9,800,000| 
| AAA | 9,799,999 - 9,700,000|
| AA+ | 9,699,999 - 9,500,000|
| AA | 9,499,999 - 9,300,000|
| A+ | 9,299,999 - 9,000,000|
| A | 8,999,999 - 8,700,000|
| B | 8,699,999 - 7,500,000|
| C | 7,499,999 - 6,500,000|
| D | < 6,500,000| 
</div>

Getting a higher grade is a massive boost in volforce. If you improve your
9,800,000 to a 9,899,999 it will give you much less volforce then going from
9,899,999 to 9,990,000. This is because the 989x-990x is going from a AAA+ to a
S which is worth more.

When starting, you might not really understand what a good score vs bad score
and that generally takes time for you to figure out. Here are some general ideas
when it comes to score though.

Generally, if you were playing a chart and didn't give up half way you wont get
a score below 9,000,000 (in the beginning you might as you are playing charts
with not a lot of notes, so the notes are worth more). This is mostly because
the only thing that docks you points using normal score is nears and errors.

If you are getting scores below 9,000,000 and you are playing level 12+, you
might want to change something to try and hit more accuracy. You also might be
playing something too hard for you.

The score is not in any way tied to a clear. It is possible to not clear with a
S or clear with a D. Of course, these are extremes. 

S is usually the end goal for charts as you have generally got the most volforce
you can get. Of course UC and PUC will give more, but those can be much much
more difficult to get then a S.
